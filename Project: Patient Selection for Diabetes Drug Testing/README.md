# Project: Patient Selection for Diabetes Drug Testing

## Project Overview:

You are a data scientist working for an innovative unicorn healthcare startup that has developed a groundbreaking diabetes drug now entering Phase III clinical trials. This unique and sensitive drug requires 5-7 days of hospitalization for administration, frequent monitoring, and patient adherence training via a mobile application. To optimize patient selection for the trial, you have been provided with a patient dataset from a client partner. Your task is to build a predictive model that identifies the most suitable patients for testingâ€”those who are likely to remain in the hospital for the required duration without incurring excessive additional costs for drug administration and monitoring.

## Project Goal:
Develop a regression model to predict a patient's expected hospitalization time and use this prediction to determine eligibility for the clinical trial. The model will be applied to filter and select patients who meet the hospitalization duration criteria.

## Modeling Approach:

* **Dataset:** A synthetic dataset based on the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset, with denormalized data at the encounter level for augmentation.
* **Regression Task:** Predict the expected number of hospitalization days for each patient.
* **Binary Classification:** Convert the regression output into a binary decision:
     - Include patients expected to stay for 5-7 days.
     - Exclude patients who are unlikely to meet this requirement

* **Key Considerations:**
* **Feature Engineering:** Extract and preprocess key medical code sets to ensure effective data representation at the encounter level.
* **Bias Analysis:** Evaluate the model for potential biases across key demographic groups to ensure fair and ethical patient selection.
